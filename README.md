# Launchpad Games Showcase

Launchpad Games is a fictional party-game studio. This project is a marketing
and discovery surface designed to promote and sell party-game packs across
multiple platforms (console app stores, Steam, and direct web purchase).

The UI should feel playful, energetic, and premium, inspired by promotional
pages for Jackbox Party Packs. Toggle characters are used as animated,
expressive visual elements that represent the fun and chaos of party gameplay
— not real players or online users.
